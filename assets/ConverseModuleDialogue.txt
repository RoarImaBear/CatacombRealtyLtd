%Have you heard about market economics? The 
%intricate dance where prices pirouette to 
%the rhythm of supply and demand?
%In the marketplace, invisible hands conducts 
%symphonies of self-interest and mutual gain.
%Why would you want to stand in its way?
%Are you aware of the magic of economic 
%competition? Of rivals sparring in the arena 
%of innovation and efficiency?
%You know, prices are the linguistic currency 
%of communication between buyers and sellers in 
%the marketplace. That's why you should leave.
%In market equilibrium, the forces of desire 
%and availability find harmonious balance,
%just as I believe you and I will.
%Efficiency reigns supreme as resources flow 
%to their most valued uses in the market. So
%why don't you efficiently disappear.
%Market failures are the occasional discordant 
%notes in the otherwise melodious symphony of 
%capitalism. But I believe we'll find harmony.
%Innovation, the engine of progress fueled 
%by the incentives of profit in the market.
%Let me bring progress to this hole.
%Market corrections, the natural cycles of 
%adjustment that keep the economic orchestra 
%in tune. And you should tune out of here.
%Trust is the cornerstone of markets where 
%reputation is the currency of exchange. That's
%why I trust you to make the right choice.
