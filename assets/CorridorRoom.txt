%A narrow passage in the catacombs twists through 
%gaps between the stone chambers. No one could live
%here. Not even a desperate milenial.
%The underground tunnel is but one of many in this
%never ending maze beneath the city streets. Dark.
%Dingy. Unlivable.
%Claustrophobic tunnels wind through the catacombs,
%their walls adorned with faded graffiti and visual
%hallucinations. And faeries.
%Beneath the streets, the catacomb passages are 
%cramped and damp, walls slick with moisture and 
%the occasional glimpse of rusted pipes overhead.
%Forgotten passages in the catacombs leading to god
%knows where. By god, you of course mean the one
%and only Adam Smith.
%A labyrinth of never ending passages not even the
%rats beneath your feet could navigate. Joe Rogan
%did not prepare you for this.
%Tunnels, tunnels, never ending tunnels.
%Who built them? What contractor? You'd have found
%them a much cheaper one.
%Echo...  echo echo echo...
%Echo...  echo echo echo...
%Astounding reverb!
%What a squeeze. Thank god your ex made you do yoga.
%If you weren't this nimble, you'd likely have gotten
%stuck... shit. One moment.
%Ew... Ewww, eww, eww. Is that?
%Shit... Rat shit... no. One big rat.
%Or a rat man. It was probably a rat man.
