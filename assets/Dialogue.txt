%I know you. 
%You're young. Eager. Relentless. 
%Ready to work, grind and hustle. 
%Ready to leave your mark on the most important, value driven, transformative 
%industry in the world. Real Estate. Parisian Real Estate. 
%While the city of Paris has been all but devoured by decrepid never-retirees and 
%their yuppie trust fund spawn, you know something they don't... The underground 
%is ripe for the taking. You will dwell lower than any realtor. Dig deeper than 
%any flipper. Plunge further to get the plunder. 
%You will gentrify the Parisian Catacombs one burial chamber at a time.
%So.
%Are you ready?
%Welcome to the Catacombs.
