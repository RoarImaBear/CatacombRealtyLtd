%Wedging yourself into a narrow crawl space, the 
%rough stone walls pressing in on all sides,you 
%wonder if even Mark Cuban could sell this.
%Squeezing through a narrow passage, the darkness 
%enveloping you as you navigate the claustrophobic 
%confines. You are the modern Warren Buffet.
%Contorting your body to fit through the tight 
%opening, feeling the cool touch of the earth 
%against your skin. 
%Inch by inch, maneuvering through the cramped
%space, your progress slow and deliberate. There
%is a skeleton ahead â€” could it be Milton Friedman?
%Wriggling through the narrow tunnel, the silence
%broken only by the sound of your own breathing.
%Sadly, not even a dwarf could live here.
%Slithering into the constricted space, the weight
%of the earth above bears down on you. Just like the
%stock market did to nana's savings last year.
%Advancing through the tight passage, each movement
%a struggle against the oppressive confines. There's
%a your mamma joke in here -- you can feel it.
%Pushing forward through the cramped crawl space, 
%your determination drives you deeper into the 
%darkness of this never ending opportunity.
%Navigating the narrow passage with precision, every 
%twist and turn brings you closer to getting that 
%bag. Big, big bag.
%Worming your way through the confined space, the 
%anticipation of what lies ahead spurs you on. Is
%that a hand under your LV loafers?
