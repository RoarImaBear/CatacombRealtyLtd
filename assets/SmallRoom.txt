%A cramped alcove barely large enough for one 
%person, its walls adorned with faded graffiti
%would make for a perfect nursery.
%A tiny chamber hidden behind a narrow crevice, 
%that screams "run as fast as you can". In other 
%words, a perfect master bedroom.
%A claustrophobic nook barely spacious to stand 
%in, its floor littered with dust and fragments.
%There's definite potential
%A minuscule cavity tucked away in the depths 
%of the catacombs, offering only enough room 
%to crouch in. A perfect oriental tea room.
%A recess barely wide enough to squeeze into,
%its entrance partially obscured by overgrown 
%roots and debris. A real fixer upper.
%A pocket-sized chamber hidden beneath a 
%low-hanging ceiling, its atmosphere heavy 
%and ominous. A perfect granny flat.
%A confined space barely large enough for a 
%makeshift bedroll, its walls lined with patches 
%of damp moss. Natural insulation.
%A tiny enclave accessible only through a narrow 
%fissure, its darkness broken only by faint glow
%of phosphorescent fungi. Real entertainers delight.
%A cramped cubbyhole concealed behind a collapsed 
%wall, its existence known only to the most 
%intrepid of meth heads. Great starter home. 
%A compact chamber nestled within the catacombs, 
%its entrance obscured by centuries of accumulated 
%sediment and rubble. A true heritage build.
